# Field-Profitability-Calculator
A calculator of field profitability by county, created for John Deere. Made by Matteo Restuccia, Vaughn Richard, and Miggy Gaspar for the Pickhacks Hackathon. Data was collected from a USDA API, a link to it can be found in a comment on ./QSAPIData/cyapi.py. To run the program an API key is necessary. Profit value can easily be calculated but we did not have time to, since it was a weekend hackathon. Likewise, web scraping is mostly implemented, but due to time constraints and conflicts with existing JavaScript code on target website, it currently doesn't work. We plan to fix these problems as soon as possible.
