# Field-Profitability-Calculator
A calculator of field profitability by county, created for John Deere. Made by Matteo Restuccia, Vaughn Richard, and Miggy Gaspar for the Pickhacks Hackathon. Data was collected from a USDA API, a link to it can be found in a comment on /QSAPIData/cyapi.py. To run the program an API key is necessary. Web scraping is mostly implemented in the test-web-scrape directory, but due to time constraints and conflicts with existing JavaScript code on target website, it currently doesn't work. We also worked on MATLAB to create a heat map for this project, but the code was not fully finished so we did not include it here. We plan to fix these problems as soon as possible.
